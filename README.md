# Season001
Welcome to our first public collaboration project.

Objective:
Build the best video games with public collaboration every step of the way. We want to include all our subscribers and whoever else would like to participate. Participants will be credited in the game for the work they produce and share.

Management:
infoGamer will overseer all production of this project. Input from the public will be gathered on a regular basis. Any and all desitions presented to the public will be determined by majority rules and the consideration of infoGamer. infoGamer reserves the right to make changes to everyone's submitted work in order to better blend the project.

Profits:
All final products created through collaborated efforts will be offered as FREE applications on whatever platforms it is published to. In order to compensate infoGamer for offering this experience and overseeing the development process, infoGamer reserves the right to implement reasonable ad monetization and in-app purchases(IAP). IAP will be created from assets directly owned and produced by infoGamer. IAP will only include public submitted assets if written permission has been granted from the owner/producer of said asset.

Rules:
- Assets submitted by participants must be directly owned and produced by the participant.
- Upon submission of an asset joint ownership of the asset is given to infoGamer.
  --The person submitting the asset retains primary ownership of the asset.
  --infoGamer retains the right to use the submitted asset on the project it was submitted for and related productions (Marketing, sequels).
  --There are no retractions of submitted assets once the assets have been implemented into the project unless personally given permission by an infoGamer representative.
- submitted assets must be clean. No malicious software! First offenses will result in a permanent band from participating in this and future projects hosted by infoGamer.
- No editing any files submitted by other users. Leave other peoples files alone! 
- No theft of other people's work. No uploading or downloading files that you did not create. Only the creators of an uploaded asset and infoGamer retain the copyrights to the specified files.
- infogamer is the managing authority of this project and reserves the final say on what the project will be and what assets will be included. (With this said, we will do our best to include everyone and rely on majority rules.)
- Be kind and considerate of others working on this project. Respect the opinions of others.
- Maintain a positive environment. 
- infoGamer reserves the right to ban or exclude any person or asset that violates the rules in this document.
